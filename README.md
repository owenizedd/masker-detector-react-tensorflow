# Face mask detector with tensorflowjs

Detect if a person wearing a face mask or not.

This is not an accurate detection, the simple approach here is to use color similarity to check if a person wraing face mask.

I think for accurate detection, we need a custom model that could detect if an face mask covering mouth and nose. Which is not possible in this project's model.
Used blazeface model from tensorflowjs with a not so sophisticated detection
